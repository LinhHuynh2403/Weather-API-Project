# Weather-API-Project
<a href="https://roadmap.sh/projects/weather-api-wrapper-service">Road Map</a>
# Description:
In this project, instead of relying on our own weather data, we will build a weather API that fetches and returns weather data from a 3rd party API. This project will help you understand how to work with 3rd party APIs, caching, and environment variables.
